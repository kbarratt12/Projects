Today your father, the King, is taking your family along on his voyage to visit an allied nation for a friendly meeting. After youâ€™ve set sailed, the winds felt a little off this specific day. Suddenly, across the horizon you see 3 ships appear with flags of your allied nation. It seems they are here to escort your entourage, but suddenly as they approached closer a different flag was hoistered, the Jolly-Roger. The pirates rammed and boarded your ship. In the ensuing chaos, your family, including the King, was mercilessly slaughtered, leaving you as the lone survivor. Desperate to escape, you leaped overboard, clutching a piece of wreckage as the pirates continued their brutal assault. Washed ashore on an unknown location, battered and mourning the loss of your entire direct family, you now find yourself alone, seeking answers in the aftermath of the treacherous attack that shattered the your once tranquil life...")
